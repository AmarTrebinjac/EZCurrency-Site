EZ Currency lets you easily retrieve the currencies supported by Norges Bank's [currency exchange API.](https://app.norges-bank.no/query/index.html#/no/currency)
The API tracks about ~40 currencies at the time of writing. If you find that they support a currency not currently available in EZ Currency, you can feel free to either create a PR or raise an issue in the [EZ Currency repository on Github.](https://github.com/AmarTrebinjac/EZ-Currency-Api)

### Retrieve currencies and their codes

To retrieve the names of all the supported currencies along with their codes, you can make a request to the following endpoint:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/currencies
```

The endpoint will return an array of all the currencies in the following format:
```json
[
  { code: "AUD", name: "Australian Dollar" },
  { code: "BDT", name: "Bangladeshi Taka" },
  { code: "BGN", name: "Bulgarian Lev" },
  { code: "BRL", name: "Brazilian Real" },
  // Rest of the supported currencies
];
```

### Retrieve currency codes only

If you wish to return just the currency codes, you can do so by using this endpoint:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/currencies/codes
```

Which will return the following result type:
```json
[
  "AUD",
  "BDT",
  "BGN",
  "BRL",
  "BYN",
  // Rest of the supported codes
];
```
