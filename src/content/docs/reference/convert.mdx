The main motivation of EZ Currency is to provide a simple way to convert currencies using [Norges Bank's API.](https://app.norges-bank.no/query/index.html#/en/currency)
Their API is reliable and provides great data, but it can be difficult to parse for a developer just trying to get some simple conversion numbers.
The rates are updated around 16:00 CET every day.

### Convert one to many

If you wish to get the conversion rates of all supported currencies to a specific currency, you can do so using the following endpoint:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/convert/all-from/{currency}/amount/{amount}
```

For example, if I want to know how much I get of each currency for 100 Norwegian Krones (NOK), I would make the following request:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/convert/all-from/NOK/amount/100
```

Which would return the following response:
```json
[
  {
    "code": "NOK",
    "amount": 100,
    "conversions": [
      { "code": "AUD", "rate": 13.83298059232822896349476422 },
      { "code": "BDT", "rate": 1095.2902519167579408543263965 },
      { "code": "BGN", "rate": 16.85005139265674760308018939 },
      { "code": "BRL", "rate": 50.34486230680159089764889493 }
      // Rest of the supported currencies
    ]
  }
]
```
<Aside type="tip">
Since Norges Bank updates their rates once a day around 16:00 CET, we recommend to cache the rates to lower your reliability on both EZ Currency and Norges Bank's API uptime.
This way, if either API experiences downtime, you can use the cached rates of a given currency to convert to other currencies.

### Convert selected currencies
You can also convert one currency to another using the following endpoint:

```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/convert/from/{fromCurrency}/to/{toCurrency}/amount/{amount} 
```
For example, converting 1 EURO to USD:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/convert/from/EUR/to/USD/amount/1
```

Which returns the following result:
```json
[
  {
    "code": "EUR",
    "amount": 1,
    "conversions": [
      {
        "code": "USD",
        "rate": 1.0825001865254047601283294785
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Note that the values returned are in an array. That is because
you can also convert X amount of currencies to Y amount of currencies using comma separation as such:
```
https://api.ezcurrency.dev/convert/from/USD,CAD/to/EUR,GBP/amount/1
```
This will return the conversion rates of 1 USD to GBP and EUR, and 1 CAD to GBP and EUR:
```json
[
  {
    "code": "USD",
    "amount": 1,
    "conversions": [
      {
        "code": "EUR",
        "rate": 0.9237873696907039
      },
      {
        "code": "GBP",
        "rate": 0.7807648617947747
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "code": "CAD",
    "amount": 1,
    "conversions": [
      {
        "code": "EUR",
        "rate": 0.6775997243042992
      },
      {
        "code": "GBP",
        "rate": 0.5726924533247896
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
<Aside type="note">
We keep the full decimal precision of the rates to ensure the most accurate conversion possible. Feel free to round the rates to your desired precision.
